# Urban Sensing - Noise Pollution :closed_book: :loud_sound:

Measuring noise levels in Prishtina.

## Introduction
Analyzing urban noise pollution data is an interesting data science project because noise pollution is a significant problem in urban areas worldwide. High levels of noise pollution can cause a variety of health issues, such as hearing damage, sleep disturbance, cardiovascular problems, and stress.

Data analysis of noise pollution levels can provide valuable insights into the sources of noise pollution and the impact of noise on people's health and quality of life. It can help identify areas where noise levels are highest and where measures need to be taken to reduce noise pollution.

Moreover, understanding this phenomenon leads to the development of effective noise reduction strategies, such as urban planning and policy changes. This, in turn, can lead to a reduction in noise levels, improved public health and well-being, and better quality of life in urban areas.

## Objective

Recently in Prishtina, a 'Citizen Science' research project was conducted whereby technology enthusiasts built microphone sensors that can measure sound intensity and save the data to the cloud, as a means of better understanding this phenomenon. By having access to raw data and open to the public, anyone can get an accurate overview of sound levels in the center of the city and potentially be able to understand patters of noise.

The data was saved on a public channel of [Thingspeak](www.thingspeak.com), a platform for storing and displaying various sensor data.

The microphone sensor was placed in an urban residential and commercial location in the heart of Prishtina.
